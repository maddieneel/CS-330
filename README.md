# How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
To begin designing this scene, I first had to choose the objects I wanted to create - those objects were a pencil, paint brush, paint tray, and a canvas. My first step was determining what shapes I would use to create each individual object. In result, I came up with the pencil using a hexagon/nonsmoothed out cylinder and a pyramid. The paint tray would be planes. The paint brush will use two cubes and a pyramid and the canvas would be an elongated but thin cube. From there, I had to determine how I could create those shapes from triangles. Finally, I was able to determine the size each object would need to be and start plotting my points. To help me place them in the correct spot as well as to determine their size/depth/etc., I used the website https://technology.cpm.org/general/3dgraph/. In future work, I will continue to keep preplanning before executing. In this project, preplanning saved me the possibility of many mistakes that could have been confusing to fix due to many coordinates already written down. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
This was my first time using OpenGL, creating 3D objects, creating movement in a scene, texturing objects, lighting the scene, and more. While developing, I referenced the examples for each individual section. In addition, reviewed the videos and readings every week. As the weeks progressed, I was able to add more and more functions to the beginning project (the first scene submission). The ability to reuse previous code saved me many steps from retyping for the next assignment. At the beginning I was following almost exactly what the examples gave me but as the project went on, I was able to adjust more to make the texture/lighting/etc. my own and to complete what I envisioned. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I do not believe I will be using graphics in my professional life, but I do believe every different thing I learn (even if it is not directly what I’m going for) will only expand my knowledge of computer science and help me in the long run. This class taught me how important it is to be organized. If I would have not, there are many more chances to create errors (coordinates, camera movement, etc.).
